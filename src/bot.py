		newsapi_key - The API key for newsAPI

		watchlist - A pandas dataframe containing the names and ticker symbols of stocks we will be trading, as well as how much USD worth of that stock the bot is holding,

					but will be added to both dataframe and file when this class is instantiated for the first time
					and will be connstantly updated with data from the finnhub websocket

		sentiment_analyzer - The sentiment analysis engine, of type SentimentAnalyzer

		cash - How much cash (USD) the bot currently holds (is added to when shares are sold, and drawn from when shares are bought).
